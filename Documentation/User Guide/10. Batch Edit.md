## 1. What is Batch Edit?

Batch Edit is a tool in Specify that lets you **edit many records at once**, using a spreadsheet-like interface.

You can:

- Add or correct data for hundreds or thousands of records.
- Standardize field values (correct grammatical or spelling errors).
- Update fields to comply with Darwin Core standards.

Unlike regular data entry, Batch Edit is designed for *bulk operations*, especially for cleanup and data-quality improvements.

---

## 2. When and Why to Use Batch Edit

Common use cases include:

- Correcting many records after a data import  
- Standardizing repeated fields (collector, locality, etc.)  
- Filling missing values  
- Fixing consistent typos or formatting errors  
- Updating **independent relationships** (often not editable via Workbench)

---

## 3. Permissions & Prerequisites

- Requires appropriate user roles (e.g., Admin/Manager).  
- Requires access to **Query Builder**.  
- Features such as **rollback** may need preference activation.  
- Always **backup** the database before major edits.

---

## 4. Understanding Relationships: Dependent vs Independent

### Dependent relationships
- The child record depends on the parent.  
- Clearing all values may delete the child.  
- Example: `Determination` is dependent on `Collection Object`.

### Independent relationships
- Can exist without the parent.  
- Unlinking does **not** delete the record.  
- Example: `Agent` (collector) linked to collection object.

### Why this matters
- Dependent records need caution.  
- Independent relationships often require Batch Edit for modification.

---

## 5. Step-by-Step Workflow

### 5.1 Create / Choose a Query

1. Open **Query Builder**.  
2. Select relevant tables (e.g., Collection Object).  
3. Include **unique identifiers** (GUIDs, catalog numbers).  
4. Save the query.  
5. Test on a small dataset first.

---

### 5.2 Launch Batch Edit

1. Run the query.  
2. Click **Batch Edit**.  
3. The editing grid opens.  
4. Read-only fields are grayed out.

---

### 5.3 Editing Data

- Copy/paste, fill up/down, clear cells, etc.  
- Edited cells → **light blue**  
- Cleared cells → **orange**

Use **Revert** to undo changes before validation.

---

### 5.4 Validate Your Edits

- Click **Validate**.  
- Fix any highlighted errors.  
- Re-validate until clean.

---

### 5.5 Review Results

- Open the **Results** tab.  
- Confirm that the number of updated rows matches expectations.

---

### 5.6 Commit Your Changes

- Click **Commit**.  
- Optionally save affected records as a **Record Set**.

---

### 5.7 Rollback (If Enabled)

- Experimental feature in some versions.  
- Works mainly for simple fields.  
- Rollback ends the session — you must reload the query to continue.

---

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Always **backup** before major edits.  
- Start with small test batches.  
- Include GUIDs/IDs in queries.  
- Keep batch edits focused (one type of change at a time).  
- Save commits as Record Sets.  
- Coordinate with teammates to avoid conflicts.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Limitations

- Concurrent edits by other users can cause commit failures.  
- Some fields cannot be edited (system or read-only).  
- Dependent records may be deleted if emptied.  
- Rollback may be limited or unavailable.  
- Large datasets may slow performance.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Validation errors | Invalid data | Correct and re-validate |
| Some rows not updated | Another user changed them | Re-run query and repeat |
| Rollback unavailable | Not enabled | Check preferences |
| Wrong relationships updated | Missing identifiers | Include GUIDs/IDs |
| Slow performance | Too many rows | Split into smaller batches |

---

## 9. Summary / Checklist

1. Build & save a query with identifiers.  
2. **Backup database**.  
3. Load query → Batch Edit.  
4. Make edits.  
5. **Validate**.  
6. Review **Results**.  
7. **Commit**.  
8. Save **Record Set**.  
9. Use **Rollback** carefully.
