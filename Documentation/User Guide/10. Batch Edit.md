## 1. What is Batch Edit?

Batch Edit is a tool in Specify that lets you **edit many records at once**, using a spreadsheet-like interface.

You can:

- Add or correct data for hundreds or thousands of records.
- Standardize field values (correct grammatical or spelling errors).
- Update fields to comply with Darwin Core standards.

Unlike regular data entry, Batch Edit is designed for *bulk operations*, especially for cleanup and data-quality improvements.

---

## 2. When and Why to Use Batch Edit

Common use cases include:

- Correcting many records after a data import  
- Standardizing repeated fields (collector, locality, etc.)  
- Filling missing values  
- Fixing consistent typos or formatting errors  
- Updating **independent relationships** (often not editable via Workbench)

---

## 3. Permissions & Prerequisites

- Requires appropriate user roles (Collection Admin and above).  
- Requires access to **Query Builder** and **Workbench** tools.
- The following permission levels can be granted to Specify users: (Later, they could be used to distinguish among user levels.)  


| Permission            | Description                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create**            | Can create new records in Batch Edit.                                                           |
| **Update**            | Can modify existing records.                                                                    |
| **Delete**            | Can delete base records.                                                                        |
| **Commit**            | Can upload (commit) the changes back to the database.                                           |
| **Rollback**          | Can roll back a Batch Edit data set (experimental).                                             |
| **Validate**          | Can validate the pending changes before committing.                                             |
| **Transfer**          | Can transfer records between collections.                                                       |
| **Create Recordset**  | Can save the results of a Batch Edit as a new Record Set.                                       |
| **Delete Dependents** | Controls whether dependent records can be deleted in Batch Edit.<br>If granted, Batch Edit will delete dependents when you clear all visible fields.<br> If not granted, clearing visible fields leaves dependent records in place (fields become empty). If a required field is emptied, validation will fail.<br> Note: Even with this permission, a dependent will not be deleted if it has its own dependents. For example, deleting a Determination will not succeed if there is a linked Determiner record. |
| **Edit Multiple Tables** | Controls whether related tables (relationships) are editable in Batch Edit. <br> If not granted, all relationship columns in the grid appear read-only. |

## 4. Understanding Relationships: Dependent vs Independent

### Why this matters
- Dependent records need caution.  
- Independent relationships often require Batch Edit for modification.

### Dependent relationships
- The existence of a child record depends on the existence of a parent record.
- If the parent is deleted, the dependent (child) should also be deleted.
- If all fields of a dependent record are cleared, the record can be safely deleted.   
- **Example:** `Determination` is dependent on `Collection Object`.
    - A **Collection Object Determination** cannot exist without a **Collection Object**.
    - If you **delete a Collection Object**, the dependent **Determinations** will also be deleted.
    - The **Taxon** records linked to the Determination will remain, as they are **independent**.

When using the WorkBench, you can upload new dependent records and link them to existing records in the database (i.e. new Determinations, Preparations, etc.).


### Independent relationships
- The related records can exist on its own.  
- Unlinking does **not** delete the record.
- **Example:** `Agent` (Cataloger) is linked to `Collection Object`.
    - The Cataloger (an Agent) can exist independently of any Collection Object referencing it.
    - If you remove the Cataloger from a Collection Object, the Agent record is not deleted from the database.

You cannot update links to independent records using the WorkBench; instead, you must use the Batch Edit tool.

## 5. Step-by-Step Workflow

### 5.1 Create / Choose a Query

Run a query on the data in Specify that you wish to edit, and, most importantly, you must add a unique, non-editable identifier to your query.

1. Create or open a Query on the data you wish to edit.
2. Add all the fields you want to edit or view.
3. Include **unique identifiers** (GUIDs, catalog numbers).  
4. Save the query by clicking the **Save Query** button in the top right and naming your query.  

![query](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/911a012d-8c27-45e3-8184-4bcdccf5cd37)

---

### 5.2 Launch Batch Edit

1. Run the query.  
2. Click **Batch Edit**.  
3. The editing grid opens.  
4. Read-only fields are grayed out.

---

### 5.3 Editing Data

- Copy/paste, fill up/down, clear cells, etc.  
- Edited cells → **light blue**  
- Cleared cells → **orange**

Use **Revert** to undo changes before validation.

---

### 5.4 Validate Your Edits

- Click **Validate**.  
- Fix any highlighted errors.  
- Re-validate until clean.

---

### 5.5 Review Results

- Open the **Results** tab.  
- Confirm that the number of updated rows matches expectations.

---

### 5.6 Commit Your Changes

- Click **Commit**.  
- Optionally save affected records as a **Record Set**.

---

### 5.7 Rollback (If Enabled)

- Experimental feature in some versions.  
- Works mainly for simple fields.  
- Rollback ends the session — you must reload the query to continue.

---

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Always **backup** before major edits.  
- Start with small test batches.  
- Include GUIDs/IDs in queries.  
- Keep batch edits focused (one type of change at a time).  
- Save commits as Record Sets.  
- Coordinate with teammates to avoid conflicts.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Limitations

- Concurrent edits by other users can cause commit failures.  
- Some fields cannot be edited (system or read-only).  
- Dependent records may be deleted if emptied.  
- Rollback may be limited or unavailable.  
- Large datasets may slow performance.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Validation errors | Invalid data | Correct and re-validate |
| Some rows not updated | Another user changed them | Re-run query and repeat |
| Rollback unavailable | Not enabled | Check preferences |
| Wrong relationships updated | Missing identifiers | Include GUIDs/IDs |
| Slow performance | Too many rows | Split into smaller batches |

---

## 9. Summary / Checklist

1. Build & save a query with identifiers.  
2. **Backup database**.  
3. Load query → Batch Edit.  
4. Make edits.  
5. **Validate**.  
6. Review **Results**.  
7. **Commit**.  
8. Save **Record Set**.  
9. Use **Rollback** carefully.
