# Using the Loan System in Specify

## Overview

This guide walks you through the basics of using the **Loan system** in Specify. It is aimed at **collection managers, curators**, and other staff who handle collection object transactions.

---

## What is a Loan?

In Specify, a **Loan** refers to the **temporary transfer of collection objects** to another institution or person for research, exhibition, or other purposes. 
By creating a loan record in Specify, you register a list of specimens to be loaned, along with other required loan information (loan number, date of loan, due date, agents, etc.). When the loan is returned, the loan record should be updated to note the date of the return and which specimens were returned.

The Loan module helps you:

* Track loaned objects
* Record borrower information
* Manage loan statuses
* Print reports and labels for documentation and packaging

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Loan

### 1. Open the Loan Form

Navigate to the **Loan module** by clicking the Interactions button in the navigation menu. A list of items will appear in a dialog.

### 2. Start a New Loan Record

The first step in creating a record is choosing the specimens (as preparations) to add to the loan.

Click on **Loan** in the dialog to start the process. You can click to expand one of the two options available or continue Without Preparations which creates an empty loan record.

By choosing a record set allows you to choose a record set from your Specify account to create the loan from.

This option is the easiest method to use when loaning large numbers of Collection Objects or Preparations.

By entering (catalogNumber) s allows you to enter catalog numbers separated by either a space, comma or a new line.

If there‚Äôs a catalog number that does not have any preparations (like 46534 in this example) it will say there are no preparations found at the bottom and if there‚Äôs a catalog number where no preparations available, like if it is on loan (1 in this screenshot), then it will say so below that.

Next, a dialog listing all preparations associated with the selected records above will appear.

Each checkbox represents a preparation record associated with a collection object and is labeled with the appropriate catalog number, current determination, object type, and counts.

Specimen counts reflect the number of specimens that are currently available to be loaned. An indication is also given if any additional specimens are associated with previous open loans or gifts. In these cases the total number of available specimens would be reduced by this number.

All preparations can be selected at once by clicking the Select All button at the bottom of the dialog. The opposite is true with the Deselect All button.

To select x number of preparations for each collection object type in a number next to ‚ÄòBulk Select‚Äô at the top. Typing in ‚Äò2‚Äô would select 2 of every collection object listed that has 2 or more preparations and if any collection object has less than 2 it will take the maximum amount it can.

Click the Apply button to accept the preparations and progress to the form where all additional information pertaining to the record can be added.

Click **"New Record"** or **"+"** and enter the following:

* **Loan Number** (automatically generated or manual, depending on your configuration)
* **Loan Type**: e.g., Loan Out, Loan In
* **Loan Date**, **Due Date**, and **Return Date** (if applicable)

### 3. Add Recipient Details

In the **Agents section**:

* Add the **Institution** and **Person** receiving the loan
* Make sure to check if the agent already exists to avoid duplicates

### 4. Add Collection Objects

Link objects by catalog number or using the **Search & Attach** function:

* Click **"Add Collection Object"**
* Use search filters to find and select the relevant objects
* Review that all fields (e.g., condition, container) are correct

### 5. Add Notes and Conditions

In the appropriate fields, include:

* Purpose of the loan (e.g., Research, Exhibit)
* Legal or procedural conditions
* Any internal notes for tracking

* Search for the loan in the Loan module
* Make changes as needed (e.g., return dates, contact info)
