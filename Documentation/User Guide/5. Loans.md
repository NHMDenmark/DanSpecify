# Using the Loan System in Specify

## Overview

This guide walks you through the basics of using the **Loan system** in Specify. It is aimed at **collection managers, curators**, and other staff who handle collection object transactions.

---

## What is a Loan?

In Specify, a **Loan** refers to the **temporary transfer of collection objects** to another institution or person for research, exhibition, or other purposes. 
By creating a loan record in Specify, you register a list of specimens to be loaned, along with other required loan information (loan number, date of loan, due date, agents, etc.). When the loan is returned, the loan record should be updated to note the date of the return and which specimens were returned.

The Loan module helps you:

* Track loaned objects
* Record borrower information
* Manage loan statuses
* Print reports and labels for documentation and packaging

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Loan

### 1. Open the Loan Form

Navigate to the **Loan module** by clicking the **Interactions** button in the navigation menu. A list of items will appear in a dialog.

### 2. Start a New Loan Record

The first step in creating a record is choosing the specimens (as preparations) to add to the loan.

Click on **Loan** in the dialog to start the process. You can click to expand one of the two options available or continue Without Preparations which creates an empty loan record.

By choosing a record set allows you to choose a record set from your Specify account to create the loan from.

This option is the easiest method to use when loaning large numbers of Collection Objects or Preparations.

By entering (catalogNumber) s allows you to enter catalog numbers separated by either a space, comma or a new line.

<img width="450" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13dbab63-4a6a-4612-b49a-4fd4f4c84388" />


If one/some of the given **specimens have no registered preparation** (like 46534 in this example), you will get the following error message: "No preparations were found for the following records: 00046534".
If some of the given **specimens have no available preparations**, for instance it has been already loaned (000000001 in this example), then the error message will be the following: "No preparations are available for the following records: 000000001".

Next, a dialog listing all preparations associated with the selected records above will appear.

<img width="547" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bc5a8f3-1496-439a-a778-74204a5a3192" />

Each checkbox represents a preparation record associated with a collection object and it shows the appropriate catalog number, current determination, preparation type, and counts.

Specimen counts reflect the number of specimens that are currently available to be loaned. An indication is also given if any additional specimens are associated with previous open loans or gifts. In these cases the total number of available specimens would be reduced by this number.

All preparations can be selected at once by clicking the Select All button at the bottom of the dialog. The opposite is true with the Deselect All button.

To select x number of preparations for each collection object type in a number next to ‘Bulk Select’ at the top. Typing in ‘2’ would select 2 of every collection object listed that has 2 or more preparations and if any collection object has less than 2 it will take the maximum amount it can.

Click the Apply button to proceed to the form where all additional information about your loan can be added.

 **Loan with Uncataloged Items**

If you selected **Without Preparations** in the previous dialog after selecting Loan from the Interactions menu, you will be presented with an empty Loan record:

You can now click on the **+** button to the right of Loan Preparations (0) to add additional cataloged or uncataloged items.

<img width="370" height="158" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abb5d060-ed75-41c8-a73a-b9daecdcc977" />


You can either add records using the method described above (Start a New Loan Record) or you can use the Add Unassociated Item button to create a blank Loan Preparation.

Calculated fields for Total Items, Quantity, Quantity Returned and Quantity Resolved are included on the default Loan form. These allow total counts to be captured but are not associated with uncataloged items.


### 3. Add Recipient Details

In the **Loan Agents section** add **all** of the following agents to  the loan, choosing the appropriate **roles** from the drop-down menu and the correct **agent** from the query combo box:
1. Authoriser: 
2. Preparer:   
3. Receiver:   
4. Borrower:
   

### 4. Add Notes and Conditions

In the appropriate fields, include:

* Purpose of the loan (e.g., Research, Exhibit)
* Legal or procedural conditions
* Any internal notes for tracking


### 5. Invoices
 
Once the loan form has been successfully filled out, a **Generate Invoice on Save** check box becomes available on the form. 
If checked and the necessary query and Report have been constructed, the Reports associated with the Loan will be popped up automatically once the Save button has been clicked.
The current version of Loan reports is the **Standard Loan Form Sp7**.

### 2. Mark a Loan as Returned:

To return items associated with a loan open the loan by searching for it with the appropriate field (for example Loan Number) into the Simple Search bar or querying for it. You can find the **Return Loan** button on the bottom of the Loan form.
