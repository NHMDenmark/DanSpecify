# Getting Started with Specify 

This is a brief introduction for quickly getting up and running with Specify. 

## Accessing Specify

There are two main editions of Specify: **Specify6** (desktop program) and **Specify7** (web-based). 

For most users, especially new ones, we recommend using the web-based Specify7 edition. 
There may be specific reasons to use Specify6 instead, because Specify7 does not yet cover all features. 
At the same time, Specify7 is modern, relatively fast and easy to get started with. 
For the Natural History Museums of Denmark, the focus of our support efforts lie on Specify7 as it's a matter of time before Specify6 becomes obsolete.   

Specify6 requires a user to be inside the Copenhagen University (KU) network, either through a cabled connection or VPN. 
You cannot use Specify6 through KU's Eduroam Wifi, unless you connect through VPN. 
To be able to connect via VPN, you need to have a KU username, which you only can have when you're either an employee or registered as external partner. 

Instructions on how to install Specify6 on your machine can be found on this FAQ: [I need to (re)install Specify6](https://github.com/NHMDenmark/DanSpecify/tree/master/Documentation/User%20Guide#i-need-to-reinstall-specify-6)

Specify7 can be accessed at the internet addresses listed on this FAQ: [Where can I access Specify 7?](https://github.com/NHMDenmark/DanSpecify/tree/master/Documentation/User%20Guide#where-can-i-access-specify-7)

In order to use Specify, you need to have a user account. Please contact the Specify team for having your user account created: [Contact](https://github.com/NHMDenmark/DanSpecify/tree/master/Documentation/User%20Guide#frequently-asked-questions)

This guide will exclusively focus on using Specify7. For Specify6, a large number of video tutorials have already been provided by the Specify Consortium on Vimeo here: https://vimeo.com/specifysoftware

## Using Specify (Overview)

When you've successfully logged on you will be greeted with something like the following screen:

**Collection Selector**
To the top right it shows you what Specify collection you've logged on to. If you have access to more than one collection, it is here where you can switch 

**User Options**
Next to the collection selector there is a button with your username. When you click on that, you will get access to several options like change password, log out and customize preferences.  

**Search Field**
Below the collection selector there is a text field that can be used to search the records. If you enter a catalogue number and press [Enter], a search will be run and after some time give you the results. You can also enter a taxon name or a collector name for instance. The latter may result in taxon or agent records respectively.  

**Top Menu**
In the top menu there may be several options, depending on your permissions, namely:  
- _Data Entry_ This is where you enter and thereby register new data such as a new specimen (collection object)
- _Trees_ This where you can navigate and search hierarchical data namely Taxonomy, Geography and Storage Location 
- _Interactions_ This is where you handle interactions like Accessions and Loans 
- _Queries_ This is where you can do an advanced Query search among the different data records 
- _Record Sets_ This is where you can find and create collections (sets) of individual collection object records 
- _Reports_ This is where you can create reports and labels for your specimen and other records 
- _Workbench_ This is where you can upload and import data stored in spreadsheet files 
- _Attachments_ This is where you can peruse the different images and other files attached to collection objects or other kinds of records
