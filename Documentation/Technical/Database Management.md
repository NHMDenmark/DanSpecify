## Backing up the database

The database server is backed up by the University of Copenhagen IT services (KU-IT) on a regular basis, i.e. every night at around 22:00. 

In certain cases, it may be a good idea to make a database backup, for instance when upgrading or something similar, allowing us to choose the specific time of the backup to be made.
