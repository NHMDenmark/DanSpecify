## Logs 

You can find the logs by performing the following steps:

Run `docker ps` in the terminal. This will give you an overview of all the containers that are running in this instance:

Copy the container ID for the line that has the name specify7-1 at the end (see the second line in the above screenshot)

Run the following command, replacing 999250a6139b with the CONTAINER ID for your instance.

`docker logs â€”tail 1000 999250a6139b `

ðŸ’¡ The --tail 1000 says to show only the most recent 1000 lines. This can be adapted or removed. 

You should now see the logs for the front-end container. 

You can use the same process to see the logs for the other docker containers as well!
