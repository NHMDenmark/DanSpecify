# Support
1. Support should follow a chain; first, consult the available documentation (in software online help, resourcs on the internet [add links](#)), then ask your nearest colleagues, then the official senior user that every collection will designate. If none of the above can answer the questions, contact data office.

## User Accounts

The Data Office has created a user account for you and provided your login credentials consisting of three items:

1. User Name
2. Password
3. Master Key

You will only need the Master Key for Specify 6, and only the first time you connect from a new computer (usually after you installed Specify on your computer).

There are different four different kinds of user account, described below. There will be one designated *Database Manager* in each collection, who is granted *Manager* permissions. That person is responsible to manage the collectionâ€™s user accounts and to upload *Workbench* data.

General staff (collections managers and curators) will normally be granted *Full Access User* privileges, while students, volunteers, and emeriti will have *Limited Access User* accounts. Visiting researchers can get *Guest* accounts.

### Guests
Guests have only read access to data in the *CMS* i.e. they can view records and attachments but not modify or delete them, nor can they add new records. Guests do not have read access to all kinds of data. They can for instance not view data on *Permits*, *Accessions*, or *Loans*. Guests can use the *Workbench* but cannot upload data from the *Workbench* to the *CMS*.

### Limited Access Users
Have all permissions of *Guest* users and in addition may add, modify, and edit records and attachments for most kinds of data. *Limited Access Users* may view but not add, modify, or delete *Permits*, *Accessions*, and *Loans*. They can print labels and reports.

### Full Access Users
Have all permissions of *Limited Access Users* and in addition may add, modify, and delete *Permits*, *Accessions*, and *Loans*.

### Managers
Have all permissions of *Full Access Users* and in addition can upload *Workbench* data to the database. The manager has also permissions to modify the data entry forms and to create and manage user accounts within a collection.
