## I need to (re)install Specify 6

Specify6 is no longer supported, unfortunately. If there are certain features from Specify6 that you believe the current version of Specify7 does not support, please let us know:  specify@snm.ku.dk 

## Why use Specify? 

There are many different ways to keep track of collections data digitally. 
Many years ago, the decision was made by the organization of Danish Natural History Museums to opt for Specify. 
Why is using such a specialised software solution the best way forward rather than using spreadsheets, custom FileMaker files or bespoke databases? 
And what are the advantages of using Specify specifically rather than an alternative system on the market? 

The advantage of a specialised collections management system are the following: 

1. Single system to be supported 
2. Central repository of all data 
3. Relational structuring of data 
4. Ready features for working with data 
5. Easy sharing of data 

The advantage of using Specify over alternatives are the following: 

1. Low cost 
2. Widely used
3. Open source  

### Single system 

Managing data digitally actually requires a lot of specialized expertise. 
If different department or sections each uses their own bespoke system they need a specialist to manage their specific solution. 

### Central repository 

Saving data a central place like in the University infrastructure as is our case is by far the safest way. 
Not only is it regularly backed up, it is also kept safe from cyberattacks and ransomware. 

### Relational Data Structure 

As has been known since the seventies, a relational data structure is the most optimal way for storing data. 
1. It minimize repetition 
2. It makes searching easier 
3. It saves space 

### Low Cost

The Specify Software suite is **open source** and in principle free of cost for anyone to install and deploy on their own systems. 
Being part of the consortium has the major advantages of making sure that development continues on Specify and also that we can influence this. 
Not only that, we are also eligible for support from the Specify team in Kansas. 
This is still at a much lower price than most of the commercials solutions out there and that also often are **closed source** meaning a complete dependence on the producer of this solution. 

### Open Source 

Open source software has many advantages not in the least the following: 
1. It's in principle free to install & deploy yourself if you have the expertise & infrastructure 
2. It's in principle possible to troubleshoot any issues yourself 
3. It's in principle possible to develop your own solutions to be integrate into the main branch 
4. In contrast to closed source, it's in principle safeguarded continued development into the future by whoever holds the torch
